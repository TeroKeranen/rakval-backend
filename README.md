# Rakval Backend

## Project Overview
The Rakval backend serves as the central data management and business logic layer for the Rakval application, which is designed to facilitate efficient and effortless management and monitoring of construction sites. This backend handles all the server-side operations, including user authentication, data storage, and integration with other services, providing a robust foundation for both the web and mobile platforms.

## Technologies
This backend is built using Node.js and leverages various libraries and frameworks to handle different aspects of backend functionality:

- **Express.js**: Simplifies routing and request handling.
- **Mongoose**: Provides schema-based solution to model application data for MongoDB.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Manages secure user authentication.
- **Bcrypt**: Assists in password hashing for secure storage.

## Deployment
The backend is currently hosted on Heroku, which provides a powerful platform-as-a-service (PaaS) environment that automates many aspects of deployment, scaling, and management of applications. This allows for continuous integration and delivery, making updates and management of the live application seamless.
